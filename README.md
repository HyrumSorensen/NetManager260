IDEA:
A Network tracking app that keeps a record of all of the people you know. It is essentially a data heavy organizer that allows you to search through all of the different types of people you know and contact them.

My MVP:
- The User can login
- Contains A database that stores people organized into a few groups
- The User is able to add new people and delete them from their list
- Will contain various components and screens

Other Features I would like to implement after the MVP:
- The User can edit any part of the people data
- The User can filter through the various groups of people for easy viewing
- The User can create custom tabs for the people in their table
